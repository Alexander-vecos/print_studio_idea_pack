# Order workflow — how to create an order (for non-developers)

This document explains how to create an order in the app.

1) Open the app on your phone or desktop
2) Sign in (Phone Auth recommended). After phone confirmation, you will have a default role `guest`.
3) On mobile, press the middle + button (Upload). On desktop, go to Dashboard → Create order.
4) Fill `Client`, `Product`, `Type`, `Colors` and select `Priority`.
5) Click `Create Order` — the order will be saved to Firestore and visible in the main list.

If you see an error, check your network connection and try again. If the error persists, contact the administrator and include the time and the error message.
